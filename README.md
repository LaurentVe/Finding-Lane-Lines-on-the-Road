# Finding-Lane-Lines-on-the-Road
Create a Lane Finding pipeline that finds lane lines on the road

## Description

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project a line detection algorithm is proposed to detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

This project is part of UDACITY's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
